<!-- to get the number of minutes until the bus arrives:
  - get current time
  - make sure current time and API times are in a format that can be compared numerically
  - repeat below for each of the 3 routes:
    - for current stop & route, call server API & find the first time (binary search? or do I need a better way to store bus times instead of one giant array?) that is later than the current time
    - subtract current time from API time to get the number of minutes until the next bus for that route
      - display that number on index.html page
      - take that number above and add 15. display that as the 2nd number on index.html
 -->

 <!-- once the data above can be grabbed statically, change the clock to constantly update and make the minutes real tie update as well -->

 <!-- either use dropdown or number selector to choose stop. once clicked/selected, it will call the API to get the minutes until next two buses arrive per route -->

 <!-- refactor to be done in react, add styling, and make responsive. pretend this is going to be used on someone's phone. -->

 <!-- figure out how to make index.js connect to index.html -->
 <!-- is it possible to call the API only once and cache it?? -->
 <!-- see if moment.js will come in handy. is graphQL overkill? -->
